# Mind Studio

## Overview

Mind Studio is an AI full-stack development platform developed based on Huawei's neural- network processing unit (NPU), which allows development of chip-based operators and custom operators. It also provides network migration, optimization, and analysis at the network layer and a set of visualized AI engine drag-and-drop programming services at the service engine layer, greatly simplifying AI engine development. The entire platform offers the following four services for developers using web pages.

* For operator development
  
  Mind Studio allows development of a full set of operators, running in a real environment, visualized debugging of heterogeneous programs that are dynamically scheduled, and third-party operator development, greatly reducing the operator development difficulty based on Huawei-developed NPUs and improving the efficiency of operator development as well as product competitiveness.
  
* For development at the network layer
  
  Mind Studio integrates the offline model generator (OMG), model quantization tool, model precision comparison tool, model running profiling tool, and log analysis tool, greatly improving the efficiency of migration, analysis, and optimization of network models.
  
* For AI engine development
  
  Mind Studio provides AI engines that support visualized drag-and-drop programming as well as a large number of technologies on automatic algorithm code generation, dramatically reducing the development difficulty for developers. Equipped with various algorithm engines, such as ResNet-18, Mind Studio enhances the development and migration efficiency of the AI algorithm engine.

* For application development:
  
  Mind Studio provides developers with a graphically integrated development environment by integrating various tools, such as Profiler and Compiler, allowing them to perform full-process development across project management, compilation, commissioning, simulation, and performance analysis, and therefore greatly enhancing the development efficiency.
